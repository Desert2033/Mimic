Thank you for buying this product.

This package should just work, however if something will go wrong please read this guide.

To get exactly same visuals like in the promo video and screenshots project should be set to Deferred (Rendering Path), and Linear (Color Space), you can find those options by going to File/Build settings and then player settings/other settings. 

However If you want to use this project for mobile game, those settings need to be set to Forward and Gamma. Dont worry It will work on mobile however visuals might be slightly different. If you want to use this product to work on mobile I've created 2 set of lights and cameras in demo scene which you should enable and disable other camera and light:

- Deferred / Linear for consoles/PC
- Forward Gamma for Mobile 

This package also is using Unity Cinematic Image Effects, mainly to tweak visuals a bit, if you will get any errors after openning this package please consider downloading Cinematic Image Effects (https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/51515) from unity assets store
